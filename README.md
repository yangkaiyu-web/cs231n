### Assignment #1: Image Classification, kNN, SVM, Softmax, Fully Connected Neural Network
#### Q1: k-Nearest Neighbor classifier
The notebook knn.ipynb will walk you through implementing the kNN classifier.

#### Q2: Training a Support Vector Machine
The notebook svm.ipynb will walk you through implementing the SVM classifier.

#### Q3: Implement a Softmax classifier
The notebook softmax.ipynb will walk you through implementing the Softmax classifier.

#### Q4: Two-Layer Neural Network
The notebook two_layer_net.ipynb will walk you through the implementation of a two-layer neural network classifier.

#### Q5: Higher Level Representations: Image Features
The notebook features.ipynb will examine the improvements gained by using higher-level representations as opposed to using raw pixel values.

### Assignment #2: Fully Connected and Convolutional Nets, Batch Normalization, Dropout, Pytorch & Network Visualization
#### Q1: Multi-Layer Fully Connected Neural Networks
The notebook FullyConnectedNets.ipynb will have you implement fully connected networks of arbitrary depth. To optimize these models you will implement several popular update rules.

#### Q2: Batch Normalization
In notebook BatchNormalization.ipynb you will implement batch normalization, and use it to train deep fully connected networks.

#### Q3: Dropout
The notebook Dropout.ipynb will help you implement dropout and explore its effects on model generalization.

#### Q4: Convolutional Neural Networks
In the notebook ConvolutionalNetworks.ipynb you will implement several new layers that are commonly used in convolutional networks.

#### Q5: PyTorch on CIFAR-10
For this part, you will be working with PyTorch, a popular and powerful deep learning framework.

Open up PyTorch.ipynb. There, you will learn how the framework works, culminating in training a convolutional network of your own design on CIFAR-10 to get the best performance you can.

#### Q6: Network Visualization: Saliency Maps, Class Visualization, and Fooling Images
The notebook Network_Visualization.ipynb will introduce the pretrained SqueezeNet model, compute gradients with respect to images, and use them to produce saliency maps and fooling images.

### Assignment #3: Image Captioning with RNNs and Transformers, Network Visualization, Generative Adversarial Networks, Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning
